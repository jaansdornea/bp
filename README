Simple App with following two problems:

Question 1:
Implement a moving average function
 
Example:
Input:
a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
k = 3
 
Output:
[2,3,4,5,6]
---------------

Question 2: 
Given an infinite stream of positive integers and a target positive integer, implement a function which returns when and only when a combination of the elements of the stream seen so far sums to the target

Example

stream = [1,7,3,1,15,2,...]
target = 5

returns at the 4th element (index 3) because 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 (edited)
